It's a memory demon inspiried by Limbo and somme other stuff so... Experimental theme, only 2 types of orbs and pads and two types of blocks: 1.0 with black gradient and the one for decoration. The word \"psychédélique\" (French) or \"psychedelic\" (English) refers to something that relates to the effects of certain mind-altering substances, or more broadly, to experiences, art, or music that evoke vivid, surreal, or dreamlike sensations. The name doesn't really matches the level, but that's intentionnal. I tried to make an unique level, never created a memory level before. I took a random song: from the level \"Freedom\" but only the beggining of the song and it repeats two times. The first wave part is clearly inspiried by Limbo but it has a spam and it’s way easier. The second part is cube and it is ispiried by Limbo too. The third part is cube again but it’s a little break with some cool paralax effect. Fourth part is wave again, music repeates and is edited in the second half of the part. The last part is the hardest one: classic memory and timings with some cool effect ispiried by a Spu7nix’s level.", "DSUgcegnsUQ", {"kevino": "TWoWBQoVIcI", "Uranium": "0bEkgeZPa44", "Tryqz": "YCvJ3_3E-Bk", "Toffelz": "O1nz8RFIlXI"}),
